# Installation

Antigravity UI is a collection of components that you can copy and paste into your project.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Next.js** (App Router preferred)
- **Tailwind CSS** (v3 or v4)
- **Framer Motion**
- **Lucide React**

## Step 1: Install Dependencies

Run the following command in your terminal:

<CodeBlock title="terminal" code={`npm install framer-motion lucide-react clsx tailwind-merge`} />

## Step 2: Add Utility File

Create a `lib/utils.ts` (if you don't have it already from shadcn/ui):

<CodeBlock title="lib/utils.ts" code={`import { clsx, type ClassValue } from "clsx"
import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge"

export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
  return twMerge(clsx(inputs))
}`} />

## Step 3: Start adding components

That's it! You can now browse the [Components](/docs/components/text-generate-effect) and start copying them into your project.
