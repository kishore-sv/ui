# Grid Generator

A visual tool to build and export custom Tailwind CSS grid layouts. Customize the grid structure, add items, and export the code directly.

<ComponentPreview name="Grid Generator" code={`import { GridGenerator } from "@/components/grid-generator";

export default function Demo() {
  return <GridGenerator />;
}`}>
  <GridGenerator />
</ComponentPreview>

## Features

- **Dynamic Grid**: Adjust columns, rows, and gaps in real-time.
- **Drag & Drop**: Reposition any grid item by dragging it to a new cell.
- **Visual Resizing**: Scale items spanning multiple rows or columns via the resize handle.
- **Code Export**: Generate both HTML and JSX (React) code compatible with Tailwind CSS v3 and v4.

## How to use

1. **Configure**: Use the inputs at the top to set your grid dimensions and gap.
2. **Add Items**: Click any cell with a `+` icon to place a new item.
3. **Move**: Drag an item by its center to move it around the grid.
4. **Resize**: Drag the bottom-right handle of an item to change its span.
5. **Delete**: Click the `X` in the top right of an item to remove it.
6. **Export**: Choose your preferred format (JSX/HTML) and click **Copy Code**.

## Installation

This tool depends on your local configuration of Tailwind CSS. You only need to copy the `GridGenerator` component to your project.

<CodeBlock title="components/grid-generator.tsx" code={`// Reusable component code (refer to source below)`} />

> Note: The full source code for this generator can be found in our repository. It uses React state and native mouse events for the interaction layer.
