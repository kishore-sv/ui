# Introduction

Welcome to **Antigravity UI**. This is a collection of high-performance, accessible, and beautifully animated components that you can copy and paste into your apps.

## Why Antigravity?

Most animation libraries are either too heavy or too rigid. Antigravity follows the "shadcn" philosophy:

- **Beautiful by default**: Built with modern aesthetics in mind.
- **Accessible**: ARIA compliant and keyboard navigable.
- **Customizable**: You own the code. Change everything.
- **Lightweight**: Only use what you need.

## Inspiration

This project is heavily inspired by:
- [Aceternity UI](https://ui.aceternity.com/)
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- [Magic UI](https://magicui.design/)
